# UBA Project TODO

## 🚀 High Priority: Fix JavaScript/WASM Bindings

The JavaScript bindings are **90% complete** but blocked by WASM compilation issues. Here are the next steps to make them fully functional:

### Option 1: Fix secp256k1-sys Compilation (Recommended - Quick Fix)

**Status**: Blocked by missing LLVM WASM support
**Effort**: Low (1-2 hours)
**Risk**: Low

#### Steps:
1. **Install LLVM with WASM support**:
   ```bash
   brew install llvm
   ```

2. **Set environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export AR=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/llvm-ar
   export CC=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang
   export CFLAGS="--target=wasm32-unknown-unknown"
   ```

3. **Rebuild WASM bindings**:
   ```bash
   cd bindings/wasm
   ./build.sh
   ```

4. **Test JavaScript functionality**:
   ```bash
   node examples/test-bindings.js
   ```

#### Expected Outcome:
- ✅ Full WASM compilation
- ✅ JavaScript bindings working
- ✅ Address generation in browsers/Node.js
- ❌ Still no Nostr relay functionality (WASM limitation)

### Option 2: Pure Rust Crypto Migration (Long-term - Robust Solution)

**Status**: Requires code changes
**Effort**: Medium (1-2 days)  
**Risk**: Medium

#### Current State:
- `k256` crate already partially integrated
- Need to replace all `secp256k1-sys` dependencies
- WASM-compatible crypto backend ready

#### Steps:

1. **Update address.rs**:
   - [ ] Replace all `secp256k1` calls with `k256`
   - [ ] Update key derivation to use pure Rust
   - [ ] Test address generation compatibility

2. **Update Cargo.toml dependencies**:
   ```toml
   # Remove secp256k1-sys dependency
   # secp256k1 = { version = "0.28", optional = true }
   
   # Make k256 default for WASM
   k256 = { version = "0.13", features = ["ecdsa", "sha256"] }
   ```

3. **Update feature flags**:
   - Make `k256` the default crypto backend
   - Keep `secp256k1` as optional for native performance

4. **Test compatibility**:
   - Verify same addresses generated with both backends
   - Run full test suite

#### Expected Outcome:
- ✅ No C dependencies in WASM builds
- ✅ Better WebAssembly compatibility
- ✅ Smaller WASM bundle sizes
- ✅ More reliable builds across platforms

## 🔧 Medium Priority: Complete WASM Functionality

### Enable Full UBA Operations in WASM

**Current limitation**: Nostr relay operations not available in WASM

#### Potential Solutions:

1. **HTTP-based Relay Proxy**:
   - Create a REST API proxy for Nostr relay operations
   - WASM calls HTTP endpoints instead of WebSocket directly
   - Maintains UBA functionality in browsers

2. **Pure WASM WebSocket Implementation**:
   - Replace `tokio-tungstenite` with WASM-compatible WebSocket
   - Use browser's native WebSocket API
   - Enable direct Nostr relay communication

3. **Hybrid Approach**:
   - Keep current native implementation
   - Add WASM-specific relay client
   - Feature-flag based compilation
